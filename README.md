# Bankamaticks
	A simple modern looking banking account page

The goal of Bankamaticks  *(I should really find an another name)* was to create a clean and easy to use design template *(and I've chosen a fake banking website...)*


## Goals:


- [x] Purposing a lightweight front-end interface for your banking app/and website project.
- [x] Modern and simple looking interface
- [ ]  Contains everything it should contain...
	- [x] Main window
	- [ ] Transfer window 
	- [ ] Search window
	- [ ] Card management
	- [ ] Javascript basic events (not for now since it depends of your "*goals*"
- [ ] Fully responsive 


## How to use it:

 1. Download the full repo
 2. Just put the included files on your server directory. *[Don't forget to customize them and work yourself since it's just the design part]* 
 3. Enjoy.
